dotfiles
========

These are my dotfiles.

Implicitly a list of favorites.

## Components
* [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
* [Tmux](https://tmux.github.io/)
* [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)
* (big fan of [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs) but it's not quite stable enough.)

If on Linux:
* [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
* [xmonad](http://xmonad.org/)
* [urxvt](http://rxvt.sourceforge.net/) (the one true terminal)

If on Mac:
* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
* [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/) (or something similar)

### Neovim plugins
I rely heavily on a few major plugins:
* [Unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim)
* [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim)
* [fugitive.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
* [vimfiler](https://github.com/Shougo/vimfiler.vim)
* [vimux](https://github.com/benmills/vimux)

## Languages

### Fun
* [Ruby]
* [Clojure]
* [Elixir]
* [Lua]

### Work
* [Scala]
* [Python]
* [JavaScript]

### Stats
* Julia (promising)
* Octave (slower than you'd think)
* R (not so excellent as a language)

I have mixed feelings about Scala; it is orders of magnitude preferable to Java, but I think Clojure is the way to go on the JVM.

I'm pretty much on the dynamic side of the fence insofar as that's tenable these days.

Immutability is a bigger game changer than strong type systems.

I use a MBP at work and an Arch Linux ThinkPad at home.

Usability Essentials:
* Remap caps lock to control
* Set Mac's option to Meta

One of these days I ought to document my thoughts on tooling.
