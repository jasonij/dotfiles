dotfiles
========

These are my dotfiles.

Neovim in zsh in tmux (in xmonad) is pretty much unbeatable,
but I do often use Spacemacs as well (especially for fancy languages).

My favorite languages are Ruby, Elixir, and Clojure, and of course I have a soft spot for C and 68K assembly code (Amiga 4-ever!).

My main work languages are Scala, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and Java (in that order).
I have mixed feelings about Scala; I think Clojure is the way to go on the JVM.

I keep an eye on Lua, Rust, and to some extent Haskell and Idris.

I'm pretty much on the dynamic side of the fence.

I think immutability is a much bigger win than type systems.

I use a MBP at work and an Arch Linux ThinkPad at home.

Usability Essentials:
* Remap caps lock to control
* Set Mac's option to Meta

One of these days I ought to document my thoughts on tooling.
